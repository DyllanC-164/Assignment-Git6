Assignment 5-

For Assignment Git5 I needed to clone the Classroom GitHub Repository and insert code to a file named main.py
I started by opening the repository in VS Code by inserting the link and then edited the mine.py file 
In the file, I inserted print command one for "hello world" and one for "CS 110"
I then needed to set up a stage, commit and push in the Source control menu
once done, I checked GitHub and confirmed it was there.
